# COVID-19
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), an infectious disease which disrupts the respiratory system and causes death in the worst condition. This diseases started to sweep across the globe in early 2020 and causes millions of lives lost especially the elderly group and individuals with underlying health issues. In this project, we attempted to use data visualization tools to:

a) Visualize the progress of this disease across the world, how many lives have been affected.

b) Visualize the vaccination progress in all countries. 

c) Investigate the correlation between case numbers and other factors collected (vaccination rate, stringency index, population density etc.)

The analysis covers period between 24th February 2020 to 4th December 2021, across 6 continents and 224 locations around the world.

### Data source
The dataset is obtained from the [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus). Our World in Data is a project of the Global Change Data Lab, a non-profit organization based in the United Kingdom.

### Tool and library
Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib and Plotly 

### Observations
To date (Dec 2021), due to the recent Omicron variant, there is an ongoing spike in case numbers across the globe especially in North America which marks the continent with the highest case numbers, and United States has the highest case numbers. 
There are many factors cotributing to the increase of case numbers in each country including median age, human development index(A composite index measuring average achievement in three basic dimensions of human developmentâ€”a long and healthy life, knowledge and a decent standard of living), total deaths, vaccination count, number of smokers, and booster count.
There is still many uncertainties in the years to come, waves after waves were caused by the rapid variant change. Whether vaccinations could combat the disease in near future is still unknown. However, the death counts in most regions are seem to be declining despite the increase of case numbers. Each country is taking their own measures to keep the case numbers in control while at the same time stabilizing the economy condition.
